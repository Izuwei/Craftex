# Craftex

Web application for advanced text filtration with the option of easy prototyping and tuning, without the necessity to know programming techniques. The basic principle is the choice of text tools and their inserting into the sequence, so called pipeline, which is typical for shell, from which the application draws inspiration. Tools can be also additionally edited or swapped. Another way of tuning is realized using so called breakpoints, through which it is easy to quickly focus on chosen lines of the text. This way, the application offers functionality in two separated modes, between which the users can switch anytime according to their needs. Also it is possible to generate equivalent shell expression.
